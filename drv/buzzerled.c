 * \brief Generic library to handle buzzers and leds
 *
 * This library is divided into three different layers:
 *
 *  - The topmost portable layer is buzzerled.[ch] which exposes a common API
 *    enable/disable the devices. Basically, it handles the asynchronism to
 *    implement bld_beep and bld_repeat.
 *  - The middle layer is CPU-specific and exposes a single main function which
 *    turns on/off each device.
 *  - The lower layer is board-specific and communicates with the middle layer
 *    with any required API. The idea is that devices can be tied to the CPU in
 *    many different ways (many different pins), so this part should describe
 *    which devices are present, and how they are connected.
