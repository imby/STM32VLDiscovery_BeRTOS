 * \brief Kernel switch context benchmark.
 *
 * This benchmark show you the switch context time. This measure is make
 * by hp timer that measure accurately the kernel switch context time, and print
 * it on serial debug. If you want not use the hp timer you can measure this
 * time using one oscilloscope, connected to one board led. To use this
 * mode you should disable hp timer and implement hw_led.h low level module.
