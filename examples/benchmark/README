In this directory there are a couple of projects useful to measure various
BeRTOS features. Not all the projects are meaningful programs, for example
flash occupation benchmarks just call once most or all functions of a module
just to let the compiler generate the corresponding code.

Below there's a description of single projects:
 - kernel-only_arm/: priority kernel, signals, message queues.
